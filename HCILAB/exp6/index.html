    <p>Here's a breakdown of HTML structure and CSS styling demonstrate the Gestalt principles:
        <br> 
        <hr>
        <b>1. Similarity</b>
        <span id="Similarity">
        Play/Pause buttons: They share the same shape, color (.similar class), and visual style. This signals their relatedness and function to the user.
        </span>
        <hr>
        
        <b>2. Proximity</b>
        <span id="Proximity">
        Checkboxes and task labels: Located close together, users naturally perceive them as connected items.
        Image editor tools: The "Crop", "Rotate", and "Resize" buttons are grouped in close proximity, conveying a relationship as a set of tools.
        </span>
        <hr>
        
        <b>3. Closure</b>
        <span id="Closure">
        Cards and sections: Although subtle, the boxes around cards and sections suggest complete shapes, even if the borders aren't fully "closed". This helps users recognize them as distinct units of information.
        </span>
        <hr>
        
        <b>4. Continuation</b>
        <span id="Continuation">
        Placeholder in the search bar: Though the search bar has a background, the fainter placeholder text implies a line that could continue further to the right, leading the user in the direction they should type.
        <hr>
        </span>
        
        <b>5. Figure-Ground</b>
        <span id="Figure-Ground">
        Cards, sections, search bar: Each has a background color that distinguishes it from the main page background, instantly drawing the user's focus to the content.
        Image editor: The image itself is the figure against the tool section's background. This separation lets the user concentrate on editing actions.
        <hr>
        </span>

        
        <b>6. Symmetry & Order</b>
        <span id="Symmetry">
        Overall layout: Content is placed within a central container, creating a sense of balance.
        Card alignment: Cards are spaced symmetrically, providing a sense of organization and calmness.
        Tool buttons: Evenly spaced and consistently styled buttons create order and predictability.
        </span>
